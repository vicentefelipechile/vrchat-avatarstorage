# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why aren't they included in the download?
Poiyomi and VRCFury are third-party tools that are constantly updated. Avatar creators cannot legally redistribute them, so you must download them directly from their official sources.

### What does a typical avatar download include?
An avatar download typically includes: FBX/Blend files of the 3D model, textures, materials, Unity prefabs, and sometimes configuration files. It does NOT include shaders or plugins like Poiyomi or VRCFury.

### What happens if I don't install Poiyomi?
If an avatar uses Poiyomi and you don't have it installed, you'll see materials in magenta (bright pink) in Unity, indicating the shader is missing. The avatar won't look correct.

### Do I need the Pro version of Poiyomi?
It depends on the avatar. Most work with the free version. If an avatar requires the Pro version, the creator will indicate it in the description. Pro features include refraction effects, fur shader, and geometry effects.

### What is the .spp (Substance Painter) or Photoshop (.psd) files?
The **.spp** file is the texture project for the "Substance 3D Painter" program (just like a **.psd** is for Photoshop). These files are **NOT necessary** to upload the avatar to VRChat. They are included only if you want to edit, repaint or create custom textures for clothing, body or hair. If you don't know how to edit textures, you can completely ignore them.

### What is the .blend file?
The **.blend** file is the original 3D model saved in Blender format (a free 3D modeling software). Like the texture files, **you DO NOT need it to install or upload your avatar to VRChat**. It is provided in case you want to open the model in Blender to edit the mesh, make custom clothing, or modify the bones.

> [!NOTE]
> Note
> To upload an avatar to VRChat, **you only need to use the Unity package (`.unitypackage`)**. Editing tools like Substance Painter (.spp) or Blender (.blend) are completely optional and intended for creators who want to make advanced modifications.
