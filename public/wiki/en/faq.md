# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why aren't they included in the download?
Poiyomi and VRCFury are third-party tools that are constantly updated. Avatar creators cannot legally redistribute them, so you must download them directly from their official sources.

### What does a typical avatar download include?
An avatar download typically includes: FBX/Blend files of the 3D model, textures, materials, Unity prefabs, and sometimes configuration files. It does NOT include shaders or plugins like Poiyomi or VRCFury.

### What happens if I don't install Poiyomi?
If an avatar uses Poiyomi and you don't have it installed, you'll see materials in magenta (bright pink) in Unity, indicating the shader is missing. The avatar won't look correct.

### Do I need the Pro version of Poiyomi?
It depends on the avatar. Most work with the free version. If an avatar requires the Pro version, the creator will indicate it in the description. Pro features include refraction effects, fur shader, and geometry effects.
