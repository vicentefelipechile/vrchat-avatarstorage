## What is it?
**DPS** (Dynamic Penetration System) is a system created by **Raliv** that allows objects and avatar parts to interact physically, simulating penetration with mesh deformation.

It was the industry standard for years, but is currently being replaced by **SPS** (which is free and more modern). However, many older avatars still use it.

## What is it for?
- **Physical Interaction:** Allows a "penetrator" to deform an "orifice" realistically.
- **Interactive Lighting:** Uses a lighting system to detect proximity and depth.

## Disadvantages compared to SPS
- **Cost:** DPS is a paid product (Gumroad).
- **Performance:** It is less efficient than SPS due to the use of real-time lights.
- **Complexity:** Manual setup is more tedious.
- **Limitations:** Sometimes struggles with multiple penetrators or distances.

## Where to get it?
- [Gumroad - Raliv DPS](https://raliv.gumroad.com/l/lwthuB)

## How to install it?
1. Purchase and download the package from Gumroad.
2. Import the package into Unity.
3. Ensure you have **Poiyomi Pro** (recommended) or a compatible version of Poiyomi.
4. Use the `Tools > Raliv > Penetrator` menu tools to configure your objects.

> [!TIP]
> Tip
> If you have an avatar with DPS, you can use **VRCFury** to automatically upgrade it to **SPS**. This improves performance and compatibility without losing functionality.
