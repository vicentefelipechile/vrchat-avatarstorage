## What are Haptics?
Haptics in VRChat allow what you feel in-game to translate to the real world. Through the **OSC** (Open Sound Control) protocol, VRChat can send signals to external software that controls your sex toys (like Lovense).

## Recommended Software: OscGoesBrrr (OGB)
Although there are several options, **OscGoesBrrr** is the community standard for being free, powerful, and easy to configure.

### OGB Features
- **Automatic Detection:** Works automatically with avatars that have SPS or DPS.
- **Dynamic Intensity:** Vibration varies according to depth and speed of penetration.
- **Low Latency:** Almost instant response.

### Basic Installation
1. Download **OscGoesBrrr** from its [official page or GitHub](https://github.com/OscToys/OscGoesBrrr).
2. Connect your toy (Lovense Lush, Hush, etc.) to your PC via Bluetooth or the Lovense USB adapter.
3. Open OGB and ensure it detects your toy.
4. In VRChat, enable OSC in the Radial Menu (`Options > OSC > Enabled`).

## Avatar Preparation
For your avatar to send signals to the software, it needs to have specific components.

### Automatic Method (Recommended)
The easiest way is to use the automatic tool from OGB or **VRCFury**.
1. If you use **VRCFury** to install SPS, you are almost ready! VRCFury adds the necessary contacts.
2. If you use **OGB**, it has a tool in Unity that scans your avatar and adds the necessary parameters for the toys.

## Common Hardware
- **Lovense:** The most compatible and stable brand for VRChat. Popular models: Lush 3 (vibrator), Hush (plug), Max (masturbator).
- **Gamepad:** OGB can also vibrate your Xbox/PlayStation controller if you don't have specific toys.

> [!WARNING]
> Security
> Never download scripts from unknown sources that promise "money" or "admin functions" via OSC. Use only trusted software like OscGoesBrrr or VibeCheck.
