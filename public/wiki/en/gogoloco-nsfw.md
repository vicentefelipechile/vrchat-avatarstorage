# NSFW Locomotion

## What is it?
**NSFW Locomotion** is a customized and explicit version of the **GoGo Loco** system (originally created by franada). It is designed specifically for "adult-themed" or ERP avatars, expanding locomotion functionalities to include suggestive or explicit poses and animations.

It maintains all the functions of the original GoGo Loco but adds specific content for intimate interactions.

> [!WARNING]
> Important
> **DO NOT install NSFW Locomotion and regular Gogo Loco in the same project.** They share menu and layer names, which will cause conflicts and errors. Choose only one.

## Features
- **GoGo Loco Base:** Includes all standard flight, scale, and pose functions.
- **"Poses Only" Version:** Lightweight, adds only additional static poses.
- **"Emotes + Poses" Version:** Includes full emotes, dynamic movements, and custom animations for roleplay.
- **Easy Installation:** Integration with **VRCFury** and a one-click installation script.

## Where to get it?
- [GitHub - NSFW Locomotion](https://github.com/LastationVRChat/NSFW-Locomotion)
- [Lastation Package Listing (For VCC)](https://lastationvrchat.github.io/Lastation-Package-Listing/)

## How to install it? (Recommended with VCC)
The easiest way is to use the **VRChat Creator Companion (VCC)**.

1. Add the **Lastation Package Listing (LPL)** repository to your VCC.
2. Search for and install the **NSFW Locomotion** package.
3. Make sure you have **VRCFury** installed in the project via VCC as well.
4. Open your Unity project.
5. In the top menu bar, go to: `LastationVRChat` -> `NSFW Locomotion`.
6. Select your avatar and choose the version you want:
   - **Full Version:** (Emotes + Poses)
   - **Poses Version:** (Poses only, lighter)

## Manual Installation
If you prefer not to use VCC (not recommended):
1. Download the latest "Release" from GitHub.
2. Import the package into Unity.
3. Drag the corresponding prefab to your avatar (the one that indicates `(VRCFury)`).
   - Use `WD` if you have "Write Defaults" enabled, or the normal version if not.
