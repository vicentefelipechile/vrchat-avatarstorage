# Gogo Loco

<span class="badge">RECOMMENDED</span>

## What is it?
Gogo Loco is an advanced locomotion system for VRChat avatars created by **franada**. It allows desktop and VR users without "full body tracking" to access posing, flying, and avatar adjustment functions that would not normally be available.

## What is it for?
- **Static Poses:** Allows sitting, lying down, and performing various artistic poses anywhere.
- **Full Body Simulation:** Includes animations that simulate having leg trackers.
- **Flight:** Allows flying in worlds that have collision or jump restrictions.
- **Height Adjustment:** Allows scaling the size of your avatar within the game.
- **Stationary Mode:** Allows moving your avatar visually without physically moving (useful for photos).

> [!NOTE]
> Note
> Although it can be installed manually, it is strongly recommended to use **VRCFury** to facilitate installation and avoid conflicts with other menus.
